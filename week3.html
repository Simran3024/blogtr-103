            <h3>Day 1: Starting Data Flow and Requirements Diagrams for Masterji Chatbot</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, July 8, 2024</p>
            <p>Started creating the data flow diagram and requirements diagram for the Masterji Chatbot project. This process involved mapping out the systemâ€™s functionality, how data will flow through the system, and understanding the key components necessary for the chatbot to function properly.</p>

    <h3>Day 2: Text Extraction Software Building</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, July 9, 2024</p>
    <p>Worked on developing text extraction software to process and extract meaningful data from unstructured text. This involved researching and implementing methods for efficient text parsing and content extraction from various document types. To enhance the accuracy of extraction, the system was integrated with the Gemini API key, enabling the use of advanced natural language processing models. Additionally, the text extraction process was fine-tuned using custom training data, ensuring the software could handle specific types of documents and provide more precise results.</p>

    <h3>Day 3: Data Cleaning, Separation, and Training Data Preparation</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, July 10, 2024</p>
    <p>On this day, the focus was on data cleaning and separation for the Masterji Chatbot project. This critical task involved removing irrelevant or incomplete data to ensure that the dataset used for training the chatbot was accurate and reliable. Additionally, we addressed formatting inconsistencies in the data to standardize it across all entries. Following this, the cleaned data was categorized into distinct groups (such as different language inputs or types of queries) to facilitate more efficient processing within the chatbot system. Finally, this structured and cleaned data served as the foundation for creating a well-organized training dataset, which was used to improve the chatbot's performance in understanding and responding accurately to user queries.</p>

    <h3>Day 4: Working on Website for Trakki Organization Using Django and PostgreSQL</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, July 11, 2024</p>
    <p>Focused on developing the website for the Trakki organization using Django and PostgreSQL. This task involved setting up the backend architecture, including building models, views, and controllers in Django to handle various user interactions. Additionally, I worked on defining the database schema in PostgreSQL, ensuring efficient data storage, and establishing relationships between different entities. This setup was essential for supporting the dynamic functionality of the website, such as user registration, data management, and content display. The goal was to ensure smooth interaction between the backend systems and the frontend, allowing for seamless user experiences and smooth navigation on the website.</p>

    <h3>Day 5: Solving Errors Found While Working on UI and Backend</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Friday, July 12, 2024</p>
    <p>Focused on identifying and resolving errors encountered while working on both the UI and backend of the Trakki website. The errors ranged from issues in the frontend, such as layout inconsistencies, broken links, or incorrect data display, to backend issues like database queries not returning expected results or improper API handling. Through debugging, I identified the root causes and implemented fixes, ensuring that both the UI and backend were fully functional. Additionally, I worked on optimizing the user experience by improving UI responsiveness and ensuring the backend logic worked seamlessly. This troubleshooting process was crucial to enhancing the stability and usability of the website, ensuring that it was both efficient and user-friendly.</p>
