    <h3>Day 1: Start Making Chatbot UI</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, July 15, 2024</p>
    <p>On Day 1 of our last week, we began developing the user interface (UI) for the Masterji Chatbot. The primary goal was to create an engaging, user-friendly, and intuitive layout. This involved wireframing the main components of the chatbot, including the input field, send button, and message display area.</p>
    <p>We focused on ensuring that the design was responsive and visually appealing, with clear visibility for users of all ages and backgrounds. A key consideration was the chatbot's accessibility features, such as easy navigation and clear fonts. We also implemented an option for users to toggle between light and dark modes for enhanced comfort during interaction.</p>
   <p>In addition to the layout, we began working on interactive elements like buttons and chatting interfaces, which will allow users to select various options during their conversation with the chatbot. We ensured that these elements were easy to click, with large enough clickable areas to accommodate users on both mobile and desktop devices.</p>

    <h3>Day 2: Training of Masterji Chatbot with Student Data</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, July 16, 2024</p>
    <p>On Day 2, we focused on training the Masterji Chatbot with a dataset of student interactions. The goal was to enhance the chatbot’s ability to understand and respond accurately to a variety of queries that students may have.</p>
    <p>We gathered data from multiple sources, including past student queries, common questions regarding academics, and FAQs related to college events. Using this data, we fine-tuned the GPT-4 model to understand the context better and provide personalized responses.</p>
    <p>For the training, we utilized the GPT-4 API to process and model the dataset. We provided the chatbot with a variety of questions and answers, ensuring it could handle both simple and complex queries in a natural, conversational style.</p>
    <p>Throughout the process, we tested the chatbot’s responses by simulating student interactions. Adjustments were made to improve accuracy, including refining the training dataset by adding more contextual examples and responses to edge cases.</p>
    <p>By the end of the day, the Masterji Chatbot was able to provide much more relevant and precise answers to a wide range of student queries. The chatbot is now better equipped to understand both academic and non-academic questions, laying the groundwork for the next phase of integration with the UI and advanced features.</p>

                    <h3>Day 3: Integration Between UI and Training Model</h3>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, July 17, 2024</p>
                    <p>Integrated the user interface with the trained model to ensure real-time interaction between the user and the chatbot, enabling responses based on the student's data.</p>

                    <h3>Day 4: Enhance User Experience by Providing Punjabi and English Language Support</h3>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, July 18, 2024</p>
                    <p>Enhanced the chatbot's user experience by adding support for both Punjabi and English languages, allowing users to interact in their preferred language.</p>

    <h3>Day 4: Embed Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) in Chatbot</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, July 19, 2024</p>
    <p>On Day 4, we focused on embedding Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionalities into the Masterji Chatbot, enabling users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands and receive voice responses.</p>
    <p>After exploring several APIs for their accuracy, speed, and support for multiple languages, we chose the Sarvam AI API for its superior performance in handling both Punjabi and English speech. The Sarvam AI API offered high-quality voice recognition and synthesis, making it an ideal choice for our chatbot’s bilingual functionality.</p>
    <p>The STT feature allows users to speak their queries instead of typing them. The spoken input is converted into text, processed by the chatbot, and routed to the appropriate language model (Gemini API for Punjabi or GPT-4 API for English). For responses, the TTS functionality synthesizes natural-sounding speech from the chatbot's text output, providing an engaging and accessible user experience.</p>
    <p>We also optimized the response flow to ensure minimal delay during speech processing. This included fine-tuning the API calls and testing the system under different conditions, such as varying accents, background noise, and query complexities.</p>
    <p>By the end of the day, the Masterji Chatbot was fully equipped with STT and TTS capabilities, further enhancing its usability and appeal for users who prefer voice-based interactions.</p>
